# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create an Electron application using the electron-shadcn template with Vite and TypeScript, featuring theme toggling functionality with icon indicators and proper application icon configuration.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Electron, Vite, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Multi-config Vite setup with separate configs for main, preload, and renderer processes via Electron Forge
- **Package Management**: Uses npm with electron-forge for building and packaging
- **Build Commands**: `npm run start` (development), `npm run make` (package), `npm run package` (build)
- **Icon Formats**: Requires different formats for different platforms (ico for Windows, icns for macOS, png for Linux)
- **Theme Handling**: Custom theme helpers using window.themeMode API for toggling between light/dark themes
- **Directory Structure**: 
  - Main process: `src/main.ts`
  - Renderer process: `src/renderer.ts` and components in `src/components/`
  - Assets: `src/assets/` and `public/`
  - Vite configs: `.mts` files in root

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Updated ToggleTheme component to use Sun/Moon icons that change based on current theme state
- [DONE] Configured Electron app icons in both forge.config.ts and main.ts with platform-specific handling
- [DONE] Updated index.html to include favicon reference
- [DONE] Modified Vite renderer config to properly handle asset copying during build
- [DONE] Fixed duplicate code in main.ts and improved icon path handling with platform-specific logic
- [DONE] Added proper asset handling to Electron Forge configuration
- [DONE] Fixed issue with process.exit() in main.ts that would prevent app startup

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Set up theme toggle functionality with visual icons
- [DONE] Configure application icons for Electron build process
- [DONE] Ensure proper asset packaging during build
- [TODO] Convert main icon to appropriate formats (ico, icns, png) for optimal cross-platform support
- [TODO] Test the complete build process to ensure icons appear correctly across platforms
- [TODO] Verify theme toggle functionality works properly in packaged application
